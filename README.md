## 🎮 What is this?

This is a browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built entirely in **vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** — with **no machine learning or AI libraries**.

Instead of AI, it uses:
- 🔁 Smart loops
- 🧩 Condition trees
- ⚠️ Hardcoded counters for traps and forks

It never loses — because we taught it *not to*.

## 🧠 Features

- 🎯 **Unbeatable gameplay** using condition logic
- 🖱️ **Single-player mode** against a pre-programmed brain
- 🎨 **Minimal, responsive UI**
- ⚡ No frameworks, no libraries, no fluff — just raw web tech
